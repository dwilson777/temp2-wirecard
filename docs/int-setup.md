# Setup the SDKs

The setup process for AcceptSDK on both platforms has been simplified and now uses dependency managers and commonly used packaging tools, such as Cocoapods for iOS.

However, you also still have the ability to setup the AcceptSDK manually because all setup files are available on Github, including frameworks and bundles for iOS and .AAR files for Android.

## Setting up with Packaging Tools

INSERT GIST CODE

## Manually Setting Up

### Android Files on Github

Download all Android files that you require from the *Android AcceptSDK Github*.

### iOS files on Github

Download all iOS files that you require from the *iOS AcceptSDK Github*.
